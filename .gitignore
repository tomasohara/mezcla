# Rules for telling git which untracked files to ignore, mainly based on
# file extension but also accounting for some idiosyncratic usages.
#
# Note:
# - *** Please add examples when adding exclusions.
# - ** Also explain if used for non standard stuff (e.g., tox.ini with Python).
# - This is shared across projects, so there might seem to be
#   some apparently extraneous patterns included.
# - Used to pruned 'git status' output, which gets
#   shown during check-in's (as a sanity check).
# - The patterns are glob-like with the extension that **/GLOB
#   matches the glob pattern in any subdirectory.
# - See 'man gitignore' for details.
